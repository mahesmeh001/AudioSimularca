Sophia: I don’t get why everyone keeps saying there are no jobs in tech. Companies are still hiring—just look at Apple, Google, and Microsoft. The industry is evolving, not disappearing.

Amanda: That’s easy for you to say when you’re sitting at the top. For the rest of us, it's a different story. Layoffs are happening everywhere, and entry-level positions are nearly impossible to find.

Sophia: But that’s always been the case with competitive industries. The people who adapt, upskill, and stay ahead of trends will land the jobs.

Amanda: That sounds like corporate nonsense. You’re ignoring the fact that companies are demanding five years of experience for “junior” roles while slashing training programs. It’s not about adapting—it’s about privilege.

Sophia: I started at the bottom too, Amanda. I worked hard, took risks, and built my way up. Tech rewards merit. If you’re good enough, you’ll get noticed.

Amanda: That’s a myth. Connections, luck, and background play a massive role. And let’s be real—tech isn’t exactly welcoming to people who don’t fit the usual mold.

Sophia: That’s changing, though. Companies are investing in diversity and inclusion, opening doors for underrepresented groups.
