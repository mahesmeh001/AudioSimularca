Sophia: The tech industry is going through a lot of changes right now, but I still think there are plenty of opportunities if you know where to look.

Amanda: Yeah, I agree. It’s definitely tougher than it used to be, but new fields like AI and cybersecurity are growing fast. It’s just about finding the right path.

Sophia: Exactly! And even though layoffs are happening, tech skills are still in demand across different industries, not just in big tech companies. Startups, healthcare, and finance are all hiring tech talent.

Amanda: That’s a good point. I’ve been looking into roles outside of traditional tech companies. It seems like there are more chances to break in if you’re open to different sectors.

Sophia: Absolutely. And a lot of companies are offering free training programs now to help people transition into tech. Upskilling is more accessible than ever.

Amanda: Yeah, I’ve seen that! Some bootcamps and online courses even partner with companies for job placements, which is really helpful.

Sophia: Right! And networking is huge too. Tech is competitive, but having connections and being part of communities can make a big difference.

Amanda: So true. I’ve been trying to put myself out there more, attending meetups and connecting with people on LinkedIn. It’s helping me get a better sense of where to focus.

Sophia: That’s a great approach! The job market is tough, but with persistence and flexibility, there are still plenty of opportunities out there.
